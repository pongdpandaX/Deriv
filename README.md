# Deriv
Deriv Exercise for probability game

Smart contract that implements a coin-toss game. The rules of the game
should be as follows:

A user can send any amount of crypto to the smart contract. If the amount sent is
larger than the contractâ€™s current treasury balance, the contract should send the
funds back as-is.

The contract should with 50.1% probability send back nothing to the user, and with
49.9% probability send back twice the amount.

## Technology Used
DAPP : Purely HTML and Javascript

Smart Contract : Solidity

Network : BSC Testnet 

## Live Demo
https://bsclegend.com/deriv.html

## Pre-Requisites
- Metamask
- Visual Studio Code or any Terminal Enabled Software
- Account with balance in BSC Testnet

## Overview
There are two key folders. `contracts` holds the solidty code. `frontend` contains the ui for the smart contracts.

In order to eliminate the threat of hackers to exploit the random generation, I added a variable upon creation of the contract.

This varaiable also changes in every call of the game.

# Instruction
From the **frontend** folder, run

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500) to view it in the browser.

OR you can just copy the whole [frontend](https://github.com/pongdpandaX/Deriv/tree/main/frontend) folder and open [Deriv.html](http://localhost:5500/Deriv.html)

# User Guide

## Step 1 - Verification
- Connect to BSC Testnet and Veriy your account
- Once connected, you can get some BSC Testnet tokens by clicking on the Get BSC Testnet Token button

## Step 2 - Get Dice Token to Play
- Click the Mint Token to get the BSC Token defined above

## Step 3 - Approve Game Contract
- Click the Approve Game to allow our Game contract access our Dice Token

## Step 4 - Fund the Game
- Click on the Fund the Game if you want to add more Dice Token to the Contract Dice Balance 

## Step 5 - Play the Probability Game
- Put your Dice Token Amount to bet and click the Roll Dice Button 

# Creating your own Game Contract and Token Contract

Create the Dice Token to be used for BSC Testnet using the [GameToken.sol](https://github.com/pongdpandaX/Deriv/blob/main/contracts/GameToken.sol)

Create the Game Contract to be used for BSC Testnet using the [DerivDiceGame.sol](https://github.com/pongdpandaX/Deriv/blob/main/contracts/DerivDiceGame.sol)

Update the Deriv.html file line 17-18 to reflect your own BSC Testnet contracts.
